erlang-simple-string
====================

A wrapper library that attempts to make Erlang's string, lists, and re modules seem coherent to beginners.

The initial version is purely a wrapper for traditional list-based strings.  Future versions may:

* rename some functions to make them more familiar to developers coming from other languages
* fill some gaps for string functional 
* add support for binary strings
